# Blockfund
Decentralized Blockchain Crowdfunding Management System

## Project name
- BlockFund — Decentralized Crowdfunding Platform

## What is this project?
- BlockFund is a web app that lets creators launch fundraising campaigns and lets backers donate securely, with every contribution permanently recorded on a simple blockchain for transparency and auditability.

## What does it do?
- Creators create campaigns with a goal and deadline.<br>
- Backers donate; each donation becomes a blockchain transaction with a verifiable hash.<br>
- The system “mines” blocks (proof‑of‑work) that link to previous blocks, preventing tampering.<br>
- Dashboards show live progress, donation history, user profiles, and a built‑in blockchain explorer.<br>
- A lightweight database stores users/campaigns; the ledger stores donations for public verification.<br>

## Why it matters
- Transparent: Anyone can verify funds on the ledger.<br>
- Secure: Cryptographic hashes and chained blocks prevent retroactive edits.<br>
- Low‑friction: Simple web UI; no intermediaries, fast confirmations.<br>
- Trustworthy: Permanent records increase accountability of campaign owners.<br>
